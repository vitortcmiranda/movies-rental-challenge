<h2 id="routes">üìç API Endpoints</h2>

List of available resources
‚Äã
| route               | description                                          
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
| <kbd>GET /movies</kbd>     | This endpoint retrieves all the movies in the database and returns them in JSON format. Each movie object includes its `id`, `title`, `genre`, `rating`, and the number of `available_copies`.
| <kbd>GET /movies/recommendations?user_id=<user_id></kbd>     | This endpoint generates a list of movie recommendations for a given user. It uses a basic recommendation engine that takes the user's favorite movies as input and generates recommendations based on those favorites. The response is a JSON array of recommended movie objects.
| <kbd>GET /movies/user_rented_movies?user_id=<user_id></kbd>     | This endpoint retrieves all the movies that a user has currently rented. The user is identified by the `user_id` parameter in the URL. The response is a JSON array of movie objects that the user has rented.
| <kbd>GET /movies/<movie_id>/rent?user_id=<user_id></kbd>     | This endpoint allows a user to rent a movie. The user is identified by the `user_id` parameter and the movie by the `id` parameter in the URL. If successful, it reduces the number of `available_copies` of the movie by 1 and adds the movie to the user's `rented` movies. The response is a JSON object of the rented movie.

Heres some tasks i think should be prioritize in order to not have bigger problems
‚Äã
| change               | description                                          
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
| <kbd>1-Use docker in the application(Done)/kbd>     | Docker is essential to applications, to have they running fast can improve significantly quality, and delivery time.
| <kbd>2-Fit the resources inside rest/kbd>     | The rent resource was under GET wich its not right.
| <kbd>3-Integration tests</kbd>     | Create integration tests so the future changes can be made more safely.
| <kbd>4-Unit tests</kbd>     | Create unit tests for the same purpose, we cant break things in order to improve them.
| <kbd>5-Error Handling</kbd>     | Added error handling, transaction management, and refactored code for better readability and maintainability.
| <kbd>6-Transactional</kbd>     | The movie rent resource could be done in a transactional way to avoid a movie available copies being 0, being by Optimistic or Pessimistic lock.
| <kbd>7-Separation of concerns</kbd>     | I think the movies controller should be split into movie controller and user controller.
| <kbd>8-Swagger</kbd>     | The application root could be a page of swagger, i think swagger its good for apis to have the resources displayed and kind of documented.
| <kbd>9-Model validations</kbd>     | The models dont have validations
